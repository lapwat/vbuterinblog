<title> Ask security questions </title>

<p><em>Special thanks to Hudson Jameson, OfficerCIA and samczsun for
feedback and review.</em></p>
<p>Over the past week, an article has been floating around about a
company that <a
href="https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html">lost
$25 million</a> when a finance worker was convinced to send a bank wire
to a scammer pretending to be the CFO... over what appears to have been a
very convincing deepfaked video call.</p>

</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>Deepfakes (ie. AI-generated fake audio and video) are appearing
increasingly often both in the crypto space and elsewhere. Over the past
few months, deepfakes of me have been used to advertise <a
href="https://crypto.news/analysts-discover-deepfakes-of-vitalik-buterin-promoting-scam-crypto-wallet/">all
kinds of scams</a>, as well as <a
href="../../../../images/securityquestions/fakevideo.mp4">dog coins</a>.
The quality of the deepfakes is rapidly improving: while the deepfakes
of 2020 were <a
href="https://decrypt.co/23975/vitalik-buterin-sings-pink-floyds-money-in-deepfake-video">embarrassingly
obvious and bad</a>, those from the last few months are getting
increasingly difficult to distinguish. Someone who knows me well could
still identify the recent video of <a
href="../../../../images/securityquestions/fakevideo.mp4">me shilling a
dog coin</a> as a fake because it has me saying "let's f***ing go"
whereas I've only ever used "LFG" to mean <a
href="https://slang.net/meaning/lfg">"looking for group"</a>, but people
who have only heard my voice a few times could easily be convinced.</p>
<p>Security experts to whom I mentioned the above $25 million theft
uniformly confirm that it was an exceptional and embarrassing failure of
enterprise operational security on multiple levels: standard practice is
to require several levels of sign-off before a transfer anywhere close
to that size can be approved. But even still, the fact remains that
<strong>as of 2024, an audio or even video stream of a person is no
longer a secure way of authenticating who they are</strong>.</p>
<p>This raises the question: what is?</p>
<h2 id="cryptographic-methods-alone-are-not-the-answer">Cryptographic
methods alone are not the answer</h2>
<p><strong>Being able to securely authenticate people is valuable to all
kinds of people in all kinds of situations</strong>: individuals
recovering their <a
href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/01/11/recovery.html">social
recovery or multisig wallets</a>, enterprises approving business
transactions, individuals approving large transactions for personal use
(eg. to invest into a startup, buy a house, send remittances) whether
with crypto or with fiat, and even family members needing to
authenticate each other in emergencies. So it's really important to have
a good solution that can survive the coming era of relatively easy
deepfakes.</p>
<p>One answer to this question that I often hear in crypto circles is:
"you can authenticate yourself by providing a cryptographic signature
from an address attached to your ENS / proof of humanity profile /
public PGP key". This is an appealing answer. However, it completely
misses the point of why involving other people when signing off on
transactions is useful in the first place. Suppose that you are an
individual with a personal multisig wallet, and you are sending off a
transaction that you want some co-signers to approve. Under what
circumstances would they approve it? <em>If they're confident that
you're the one who actually wants the transfer to happen</em>. If it's a
hacker who stole your key, or a kidnapper, they would not approve. In an
enterprise context, you generally have more layers of defense; but even
still, an attacker could potentially impersonate a manager not just for
the final request, but also for the earlier stages in the approval
process. They may even hijack a legitimate request-in-progress by
providing the wrong address.</p>
<p>And so in many cases, <strong>the other signers accepting that you
are you if you sign with your key kills the whole point: it turns the
entire contract into a 1-of-1 multisig where someone needs to only grab
control of your single key in order to steal the funds!</strong></p>
<p>This is where we get to one answer that actually makes some sense:
<strong>security questions</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="security-questions">Security questions</h2>
<p>Suppose that someone texts you claiming to be a particular person who
is your friend. They are texting from an account you have never seen
before, and they are claiming to have lost all of their devices. How do
you determine if they are who they say they are?</p>
<p>There's an obvious answer: <strong>ask them things that only they
would know about their life</strong>. These should be things that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You know</li>
<li>You expect them to remember</li>
<li>The internet does not know</li>
<li>Are difficult to guess</li>
<li>Ideally, even someone who has hacked corporate and government
databases does not know</li>
</ol>
<p>The natural thing to ask them about is <strong>shared
experiences</strong>. Possible examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the two of us last saw each other, what restaurant did we eat
at for dinner, and what food did you have?</li>
<li>Which of our friends made that joke about an ancient politician? And
which politician was it?</li>
<li>Which movie did we recently watch that you did not like?</li>
<li>You suggested last week that I chat with ____ about the possibility
of them helping us with ____ research?</li>
</ul>

<p><small><i>Actual example of a security question that someone recently
used to authenticate me.</i></small></p>
</center>
<p><br></p>
<p>The more unique your <em>question</em> is, the better. Questions that
are right on the edge where someone has to think for a few seconds and
might even forget the answer are good: but if the person you're asking
<em>does</em> claim to have forgotten, make sure to ask them three more
questions. Asking about "micro" details (what someone liked or disliked,
specific jokes, etc) is often better than "macro" details, because the
former are generally much more difficult for third parties to
accidentally be able to dig up (eg. if even one person posted a photo of
the dinner on Instagram, modern LLMs may well be fast enough to catch
that and provide the location in real time). If your question is
potentially guessable (in the sense that there are only a few potential
options that make sense), stack up the entropy by adding another
question.</p>
<p>People will often stop engaging in security practices if they are
dull and boring, so it's healthy to make security questions fun! They
can be a way to remember positive shared experiences. And they can be an
incentive to actually have those experiences in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="complements-to-security-questions">Complements to security
questions</h2>
<p>No single security strategy is perfect, and so it's always best to
stack together multiple techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-agreed code words</strong>: when you're together,
intentionally agree on a shared code word that you can later use to
authenticate each other.</li>
<li>Perhaps even agree on a <strong>duress key</strong>: a word that you
can innocently insert into a sentence that will quietly signal to the
other side that you're being coerced or threatened. This word should be
common enough that it will feel natural when you use it, but rare enough
that you won't accidentally insert it into your speech.</li>
<li>When someone is sending you an ETH address, ask them to
<strong>confirm it on multiple channels</strong> (eg. Signal and Twitter
DM, on the company website, or even through a mutual acquaintance)</li>
<li><strong>Guard against man-in-the-middle attacks</strong>: Signal "<a
href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007060632-What-is-a-safety-number-and-why-do-I-see-that-it-changed">safety
numbers</a>", Telegram <a
href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-30-telegrams-voice-calls-are-secured-by-emojis.html">emojis</a>
and similar features are all good to understand and watch out for.</li>
<li><strong>Daily limits and delays</strong>: simply impose delays on
highly consequential and irreversible actions. This can be done either
at policy level (pre-agree with signers that they will wait for N hours
or days before signing) or at code level (impose limits and delays in
smart contract code)</li>
</ul>

<p><small><i>A potential sophisticated attack where an attacker
impersonates an executive and a grantee at multiple steps of an approval

probably better to use both.</i></small></p>

<p>Security questions are nice because, unlike so many other techniques
that fail because they are not human-friendly, security questions build
off of information that human beings are naturally good at remembering.
I have used security questions for years, and it is a habit that
actually feels very natural and not awkward, and is worth including into
your workflow - in addition to your other layers of protection.</p>
<p>Note that "individual-to-individual" security questions as described
above are a very different use case from "enterprise-to-individual"
security questions, such as when you call your bank to reactivate your
credit card after it got deactivated for the 17th time after you travel
to a different country, and once you get past the 40-minute queue of
annoying music a bank employee appears and asks you for your name, your
birthday and maybe your last three transactions. The kinds of questions
that an individual knows the answers to are very different from what an
enterprise knows the answers to. Hence, it's worth thinking about these
two cases quite separately.</p>
<p>Each person's situation is unique, and so the kinds of unique shared
information that you have with the people you might need to authenticate
with differs for different people. It's generally better to adapt the
technique to the people, and not the people to the technique. A
technique does not need to be perfect to work: the ideal approach is to
stack together multiple techniques at the same time, and choose the
techniques that work best for you. In a post-deepfake world, we do need
to adapt our strategies to the new reality of what is now easy to fake
and what remains difficult to fake, but as long as we do, staying secure
continues to be quite possible.</p>
